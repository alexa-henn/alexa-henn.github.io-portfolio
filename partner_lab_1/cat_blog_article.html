            <h3><em>Dear readers,</em></h3>
            <p>Today, Layla barked in my presence.<br><br>I tried to tell her that this was strictly prohibited under the law. 
                However, she persisted. She later claimed there was an <em>intruder</em>. I had never heard such a ridiculous thing.
                <br><br>
                She almost scared away all the birds. I would have had to reschedule my bird watching hour and it would have thrown off
                the whole day.
                <br><br>
                Luckily, I kept my cool. As I always do because I am a very fancy cat.
                <br><br>
                However, due to this whole ordeal, I only get 14 hours of sleep. I have never been so sleep-deprived in my life.
                I must hibernate for the next 3 days to make up for this. A cat needs their beauty sleep, or else they will get
                hairballs. 
                <br><br>
                And I do <em>not</em> want to deal with that. 
                <br><br>
                Especially so close to my birthday. 
                <br><br>
                My need to be well-rested and feeling my best for my big, yet very very quiet, 7th birthday party.
                <br><br>
                It's a surprise party that I'm throwing for myself. I invited Layla and hopefully she reads the dress code. 
                <br><br>No muddy paws allowed!
                <br>Happy early birthday to me!
